A electronic webpage using "React".

Step 0: Install nodejs on your computer.

Step 1: Download the source and open the root direction in command line.

Step 2: use the command "npm install" to install all of the libs that project needs.

Step 3: use the command "npm run server" to open the webpack-dev-server, and it will open the web in your browser automatically.

This is the first time I write something on github, if anybody have the advice, please tell me to improve, thanks:)
